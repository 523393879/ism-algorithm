# ISM_algorithm

This ISM algorithm is a plug-in supportive repository to accelerate a general stereo vision DNN using Invariant-based Stereo Matching for continuous stereo vision application from our paper, *ASV: Accelerated Stereo Vision System*.

## How to use

In the `ism_skeleton.py`, it gives a skeleton code for using Invariant-based motion compensation with any Stereo DNN model. There are several steps in TODO list in order to make this algorithm works.

First, you need to download a stereo vision dataset. For this, we recommend [KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth_all.php) and [SceneFlow dataset](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/SceneFlowDatasets.en.html) and pass the path to the skeleton code.

Second, download any stereo vision DNN network to test this code. In the `ism_skeleton.py`, you need to implement the functions `load_dnn_model` and `dnn_inference` to be able to load the stereo DNN model and use the stereo DNN model to geneerate disparity results from key frames.

That's it!

## Some details about this skeleton code

Inside of this skeleton script, we used `OpticalFlowFarneback` in OpenCV to compensate motions across adjacent framesã€‚ Other dense optical flow algrithm can also be used to substitute this function in order to get the disparity map from next subsequent frames.
